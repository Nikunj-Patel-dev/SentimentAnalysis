# SentimentAnalysis

The amazon fine food dataset had around 0.5 million observation about the ratinga that user gave to the food delvered to them.
We made the use of text reviews in order to train our model. Text helped us to determine weather the user was positive or negative 
about the product by extracting features using NLTK.
After Feature extraction, the next step for me was to apply appropriate classifier. I applied both logistic regression and Naive Bias
to identify which classifier suits the best to generate a sentiment model.
